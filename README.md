# Sparsity-based-Phase-Retrieval
We provide the codes of our proposed sparsity-based phase retrieval algorithms.
We publish the codes of our proposed phase retrieval algorithm.
If you use this code, please cite the following reference.
Shi Baoshun, Chen Shuzhen, Tian Ye, Fan Xiaoyu, Lian Qiusheng. FASPR: A fast sparse phase retrieval algorithm via the epigraph concept. Digital Signal Processing, 2018, 80(9): 12-26.
We suggest that all the tests are performed on the Windows 10 64 bit operator system and MATLAB 2017a.
